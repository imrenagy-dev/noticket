# Release Notes

## v0.5.0 — No Ticket

**Branch:** `claude-vibe`
**Date:** 2026-05-08

---

### Overview

Themes expanded with Green and Dimmed variants, dynamic per-theme favicons, a full visual redesign of all inner pages, smart board/backlog navigation memory, and UX improvements to issue creation — including a checklist builder, "Assign to me" shortcut, and a responsive bottom-sheet modal on mobile.

---

### New Features

#### Green & Dimmed Themes
- Added **Green Light**, **Green Dark**, **Green Dim** — full CSS variable sets with green-tinted palettes
- Added **Brown Dim**, **Blue Dim**, **Dark Dim** — lower-contrast dimmed variants of existing dark themes
- `Appearance` type extended with `'green-light' | 'green-dark' | 'green-dim' | 'brown-dim' | 'blue-dim' | 'dark-dim'`
- Appearance settings page updated with new theme tabs and icons
- All new themes get matching favicon sets

#### Dynamic Per-Theme Favicons
- Favicon switches automatically when the user changes their theme
- `use-appearance.tsx` now calls `updateFavicon(theme)` after applying a theme class
- Each theme has its own `.svg`, `.ico`, `.png` (32px), and Apple touch icon asset
- New theme assets: `brown`, `blue`, `azure`, `light`, `green-light`, `green-dark`, `green-dim`, `brown-dim`, `blue-dim`, `dark-dim`, `dark-dim`
- `app.blade.php` updated to serve the correct default favicon on first load

#### Inner Page Visual Redesign
- All inner pages received a major visual pass:
  - **Dashboard** — gradient orb backgrounds, dot-grid texture, stat card polish
  - **Projects index** — dot-grid + orb background, card hover effects
  - **Board** — dot-grid background, sprint info bar refinements
  - **Backlog** — dot-grid background, sprint section polish
  - **Issue detail** — full layout rework; two-column sidebar, better typography hierarchy
  - **Appearance settings** — redesigned theme picker with live preview swatches

#### Project View Memory
- Projects remember whether each user last visited the **Board** or **Backlog**
- Stored in `localStorage` as `noticket_view_<projectId>`
- Project cards on the index page link directly to the remembered view
- `ProjectController@index` redirects to the stored view instead of always defaulting to board

#### Custom Sidebar Logo
- Sidebar now shows a custom "No Ticket" SVG icon (ticket with a slash) instead of a generic icon
- `app-logo-icon.tsx` rewritten with inline SVG; `app-logo.tsx` simplified

#### Create Issue Button on Board
- "Create Issue" button added to the board page header when an active sprint exists
- Opens `IssueModal` with `todo` status pre-selected and the active sprint pre-filled

#### "Assign to Me" Shortcut
- Appears next to the **Assignee** label in the create/edit modal and on the issue detail sidebar
- Only shown when the current user is a project member and is not already the assignee
- In the modal: sets the select value; on the issue detail page: fires an immediate `PATCH`

#### Checklist in Create/Edit Modal
- Checklist builder added to `IssueModal` (create and edit views)
- Add items by typing and pressing Enter or clicking `+`
- Toggle done state, delete on hover
- **Double-click to edit** any unchecked item inline — Enter/blur commits, Escape cancels
- Checklist is submitted with the issue payload on create and save
- Backend `store` validation updated to accept `checklist` array (same rules as `update`)
- New migration: `checklist JSON NULL` added to `issues` table

#### Smart Back Navigation on Issue Page
- "Back" link on the issue detail page now reads `noticket_view_<projectId>` from localStorage
- Shows **"Back to Board"** or **"Back to Backlog"** depending on where the user came from
- Post-delete redirect follows the same logic

#### Responsive Issue Modal
- `DialogContent` (shared) updated to render as a **bottom sheet on mobile** and a centered modal on `sm+`
- Mobile: slides up from the bottom, `max-h-[90dvh]` with internal scroll, rounded top corners
- Desktop: zoom-in animation, `max-h-[90vh]` scroll, all corners rounded
- Form field grids in `IssueModal` stack to 1 column on mobile (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2`)

---
